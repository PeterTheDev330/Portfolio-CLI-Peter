## WHAT I LEARNT
I learnt how to structure code properly.  
How to mix functions and loops.  
I also learnt how to create a CLI Portfolio

## WHAT I STRUGGLED WITH
I struggled with restricting input to numbers only.  
Everytime I entered a character or a word, the code would find itself in an infinite loop.  
I struggled with letting the loop restart when a character or a letter is entered.
